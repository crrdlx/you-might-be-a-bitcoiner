# You Might Be a Bitcoiner

Remember the old "[You might be a redneck if...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYKXIrZ6w3A)" shtick by Jeff Foxworthy from the 1990s?

Two that I remember went like this:

- If you gave your wife earrings that double as fishing lures, you might be a redneck.
- If you think the "Nutcracker Suite" is something you do off the diving board, you might be a redneck.

Well, we need a bitcoin version. You might be a bitcoiner if...

1. If you speak hodl and fud, you might be a bitcoiner.
2. If you think seeds do not need dirt, you might be a bitcoiner.
3. If you wake up at 2am thinking about hashrate, you might be a bitcoiner.
4. If your safe word is vByte, you might be a bitcoiner.
5. If you think cold is better than hot, you might be a bitcoiner.
6. If your family has called you a retard, you might be a bitcoiner.
7. If an obvious eyeroll is seen after "bitcoin" comes out of your mouth, you might be a bitcoiner.
8. If "back in the day" refers to any time longer than two weeks ago, you might be a bitcoiner.
9. If your family Thanksgiving dinner conversation includes, "Okay, here we go...," you might be a bitcoiner.
